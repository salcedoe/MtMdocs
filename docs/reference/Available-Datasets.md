### [The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)

The TCIA has massive amount of imaging used from cancer patients. The data is
organized by cancer type. The website has a great feature that lists all the datasets and
gives you information on the location of the scans, the modality used, number of
subjects, whether the data has metadata associated with it and when the dataset was
last updated. There is even an advanced search option for you to quickly locate an
anatomical site. As of 2020, the website also houses COVID datasets. Most of the
datasets are in a large DICOM file format.

### [New Mexico Descendant Database (NMDID)](https://nmdid.unm.edu/)

Our dataset includes whole body CT scans of over 15,000 New Mexicans who died between 2010-2017. Each individual is represented by approximately 10,000 images. Slice thickness is 1 mm with 0.5 mm overlap. Warning, some of these cadavers died violent deaths

### [Head CT Scans associated with 'Validated automatic brain extraction of head CT images'](https://archive.data.jhu.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7281/T1/CZDPSX)

The data consists of 35 different subject's non-contrast CT scan, with 2 subjects having 2 scans but every other subject having one scan (in tarballs). One subject additionally has 2 scans, but from the same time point, but with different convolution kernels. Each scan has at least one reader's manual segmentation of the image to delineate the mask of the brain areas (including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). The data are from the Minimally-Invasive Surgery plus rt-PA for Intracerebral hemorrhage Evacuation (MISTIE) Phases
II and III clinical trials the Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage (CLEAR) Phase III clinical trial. Each tarball contains a series of NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) files. Each  image has manual segmentation from 2 different readers which is a binary image delineating the brain and an automated estimate of the brain by the method proposed in the paper below.
