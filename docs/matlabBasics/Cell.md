# Cell Array

!!! abstract "*For Handling Mixed Data Types (Numbers, Letters, Words)*"

## Overview

üõç The **[cell array](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html)** is the mystery grab bag of variable types. It was designed to store disparate information, such as character and numeric information, side by side, element by element in the same array. Importantly, this disparate information doesn't even need to be the same size, making cell arrays useful for organizing character arrays or other arrays of unpredictable dimensions.

## Why Cell Arrays?

### The Trouble With the Fundamental Classes

All right. So we already figured out how to store numbers, characters, and booleans in arrays (review the Basic Data Class modules if you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about). Recall that in these fundamental classes, each element of the array contains a single piece of information, either a number, a character, or a true/false, depending on the class type. These three variable types can hold pretty much any type of information that we need.

 *So, why do we need to learn about other variable types?*
 
 Well, while very useful, the fundamental data types have certain restrictions that at times can become onerous for use at scale. For example, when storing *rows* of characters in a character array (i.e. a character *matrix*), you need to pad the array with empty spaces so that the number of columns is the same across all rows in the character matrix. This gets complicated when you are trying to store a series of characters, like names.
 
 Now, the function **`char`** can simplify  this process.

!!! example "Example: Using char to pad character matrices"

    In this example, we will store a series of Girls Names that were popular in the 90's (ok, millennial)

    ```matlab linenums="1"
    common_names_1995 = char('Jessica', 'Ashley', 'Emily', 'Samantha')
    ```

    ```matlab title="result"
      common_names_1995 =

        4√ó8 char array

          'Jessica '
          'Ashley  '
          'Emily   '
          'Samantha'
    ```

    Note the varying number of spaces added after each name, save for the longest name, 'Samantha'

But, while **`char`** easily manages the padding,  we would need to run this function every time we want to add a new row to the character array, which can get computationally burdensome (a fancy way of saying *slow*). Not to mention the fact that adding extra spaces to each row of a character array can make things tricky if you need to know the length of each character array. Say, for example, you wanted to know the average length of popular names in 1995. You would have to come up with a method to exclude those extraneous spaces in your count. This is certainly doable but adds unnecessary steps to the procedure.

### Cell Arrays to the Rescue

Cell arrays solve these problems by eliminating the need for a single value (number, character, or boolean) in each element of the array. Instead, you can have a whole *array* in a single element of a cell array. To differentiate this functionality, elements in cell arrays are also known as *cells*.

Each cell of a cell array is like a box into which you can stuff other arrays‚Äî*even other cell arrays*. This can be very useful for organizing information, but can sometimes make indexing a bit of a pain.  

## Cell Array Assignment

You create cell arrays using the special character Curly Brackets: `{ }`.

!!! example "Example: Creating a Cell array with the curly brackets"

    To create the previous array as a cell array, you use the following syntax:

    ```matlab linenums="1"
      names90s = {'Jessica'; 'Ashley'; 'Emily'; 'Samantha'}
    ```

    ```matlab title="result"
    names90s =

      4√ó1 cell array

        {'Jessica' }
        {'Ashley'  }
        {'Emily'   }
        {'Samantha'}
    ```

    Here, *`names90s`* is a 4x1 cell array. Each cell (or element) in *`names90s`* contains a character array. Notice that we did not need to add any extraneous spaces to any of the character arrays. Also notice that we used the curly brackets as a concatenating tool, similar to the way we used square brackets to concatenate numbers in numeric arrays. Much of the rest of the syntax should look familiar: Inside the curly brackets, we used the single-quotes to concatenate the character arrays that we wanted packaged into the elements of the cell array. We also used semi-colons to indicate new rows in the cell array.

There *are* some subtleties when creating a cell array. Consider the difference between the following syntaxes.

Here, we concatenate four separate character scalars:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Create 1x4 cell array"
{'a','b','c','d'}
```

```matlab title="result"
ans =

  1√ó4 cell array

    {'a'}    {'b'}    {'c'}    {'d'}
```

...so, we get a 1x4 cell vector with 4 elements that each contain a separate character scalar (`a`,`b`,`c`, or `d`).

Whereas, here we are concatenating one character vector...

```matlab linenums="1" title="Create a 1X1 cell array"
{'abcd'}
```

```matlab title="result"
ans =

  1√ó1 cell array

    {'abcd'}
```

‚Ä¶so, we get 1X1 cell scalar with a single cell that contains the character vector (`'abcd'`).

#### Challenge: Cell Array Assignment

=== "Question"
    Consider the following

    ```matlab linenums="1"
    {'abcd' 'ef'}
    ```

    1. What size cell array would the following return?
    
    2. What is found inside each cell of the  cell array?
    
    3. What are the dimensions of each of those contents?

=== "Answer"
    ```matlab title="result"
    ans =

    1√ó2 cell array

    {'abcd'}    {'ef'}
    ```

    1. What size cell array would the following return? `A 1X2 cell array: One row, two columns`
    
    2. What is found inside each cell of the array `character arrays`
    
    3. What are the dimensions of those contents? `1x4 character array` and a `1x2 character array`

---

### Store Anything in Cell Arrays

One of the advantages of a cell array is that you can store anything you want in its cells.

Consider the following:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Concatenating different data types in a cell array"
cell_ar = {1 'a' true false} 
```

```matlab title="result"
cell_ar =

  1√ó4 cell array

    {[1]}    {'a'}    {[1]}    {[0]}
```

‚Ä¶Here, we use the curly brackets to concatenate four separate values: into a cell array: a number, a character, and two logical values, true and false. This syntax packages the values into separate cells of a cell array. Notice that the output in the command window has the value in each cell surrounded by both a square bracket (or single quotes) and a curly bracket. This means that each value is individually packaged into a separate element of the cell array.

### Concatenating Cell Arrays

We can use Square brackets for Cell Arrays if we want to concatenate the individual cells. Consider the following:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Concatenating cell arrays"
cell_ar2 = {2 'b' false} % create a new cell array
cell_ar3 = [cell_ar cell_ar2] % concatenate the contents from two cell arrays into a new cell array
```

```matlab title="result"
cell_ar2 =

  1√ó3 cell array

    {[2]}    {'b'}    {[0]}


cell_ar3 =

  1√ó7 cell array

    {[1]}    {'a'}    {[1]}    {[0]}    {[2]}    {'b'}    {[0]}
```

‚Ä¶Here we first create a 1X3 cell vector, *`cell_ar2`*. Then we use the square brackets to concatenate the two cell arrays, *`cell_ar`* and *`cell_ar2`* into one larger, 1x7 cell array,  *`cell_ar3`*.

!!! note "Square vs Curly Bracket Concatenation"

    General Use-cases for Square and Curly Bracket Concatenation.

    **Square brackets** `[ ]` are used to concatenate variables of the same type and row dimension. Using square brackets will return the same variable type that you started with.
    
    **Curly brackets**  `{ }`, on the other hand, are used to create cell arrays. Any array found inside the curly brackets will be added to a new cell of the cell array. By using curly brackets, you can concatenate disparate variables and variable types into a single cell array.

### Concatenating Variables With Dimensional Disparities

Another powerful use for cell arrays is to concatenate variables that have different dimensions. This is especially useful when you can't easily predict the dimensions of the data that you are trying to concatenate. We already saw an example of this when we concatenated character arrays of different lengths into the elements of a cell array (Recall the cell array, *`names90s`*, with the girl names).

We can do the same with numeric or logical arrays.

!!! example "Concatenating Numeric Arrays with different dimensions in a cell array"
    We can package arrays of varying dimension into a cell array, using the following syntax:

    ```matlab linenums="1"
    ca = {'Ab'; [1]; [2 3]; [true false]; [false true; true false]; []}
    ```

    Let's break the syntax down in detail:

    1. The variable name to be assigned is *`ca`*
    2. On the right side of the equal sign, the outer most brackets are the curly brackets, which generates a cell array.

    3. Inside these curly brackets, there are six pairs of Concatenating Special Characters: 1 pair of Single Quotes and five pairs of Square Brackets. These concatenating characters are used to generate a different sized arrays of different classes, which is then packaged into one of cells of the cell array. Notice that the last cell in this cell array contains an empty numeric array, which is a thing you can do in cell arrays. You can leave a cell in a cell array *empty*. 

    4. The square brackets are separated by semi-colons to indicate a new row in the cell array.
    5. Executing the above statement results in the following
  

    ```matlab title="result"
    ca =

    6√ó1 cell array
        {'Ab'    } % 1x2 char array
        {[        1]} % 1x1 numeric array
        {[      2 3]} % 1X2 numeric array
        {[      1 0]} % 1x2 logical array
        {2√ó2 logical} % 2x2 logical array
        {0√ó0 double } % empty array
    ```
    
    As you can see, what we get is a cell array with six different rows and one column. In each row, there is different array of varying dimensions  including one empty array

---

## Cell Indexing

Ok, so we can now get stuff into cell arrays. How do we get them out? Well, that depends on what you need.

### Parenthetical Indexing

If you simply want a smaller cell array, then you would use the parentheses `( )` as follows:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Parentheses return smaller cell arrays"
ca(1:2)
```

```matlab title="result"
ans =

  2√ó1 cell array
    {'Ab'}
    {[    1]}    
```

‚Ä¶ This syntax returns the first two cells from the cell array as a new, smaller, 2x1 cell array. This type of syntax should feel familiar. This is how we index fundamental data types, which also returns smaller versions of the original arrays.  

---

### Curly Bracket Indexing

If you want to extract the contents from inside the elements of a cell array, then you use the curly brackets. This is easy and intuitive for one cell:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Curly brackets extract contents from each cell"
ca{1} % extract contents from cell 1
```
```matlab title="result"
ans =

    'Ab'
```

‚Ä¶Notice that this syntax returns not a smaller cell array but the contents from inside the indicated cell, replete with data type. In this case, we get a character array containing the characters `'Ab'`.

#### Extracting the content from multiple cells in a cell array

What happens when we use the curly brackets to extract content from multiple cells?

Let's have a look. The following syntax extracts the contents from cells 2 through 4 in *`ca`*:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Curly Bracket of multiple cells returns a Comma-Separated List"
ca{1:3}
```

```matlab 
ans =

    'Ab'


ans =

     2     3


ans =

  1√ó2 logical array

   1   0
```

‚Ä¶When we index multiple cells using the curly brackets, we get the contents of each cell, spit out, one after the other, into the workspace, overwriting *`ans`* each time. Here we get the contents of the first cell, `'Ab'`, followed by the contents of the second cell, `[2 3]`, followed by the contents of the third cell, `[1 0]`. Notice that *`ans`* ends up assigned only the 1x2 logical array , `[1 0]`.

!!! note "comma-separated lists"
    Using the curly brackets to index out multiple cells returns what is known as a "comma-separated list" (even though there are no commas). This simply means that the contents from each cell are spit out, one after the other, into the workspace.  Such an output makes sense from a general point of view, as there is no guarantee that the contents from a given cell in a cell array can be concatenated with the contents from any other elements of the same cell array.

#### The trouble with Curly Bracket indexing

So we can extract the contents from  multiple cells using the curly brackets. How do we concatenate that data into a new variable? Turns out, its a little tricky.

If the contents of the cell arrays are the same type, we can use the Square Brackets to concatenate the contents. For example, in *`ca`*, cells 2 and 3  contain numeric arrays. We can extract that data using the curly brackets and then concatenate the data using square brackets, as follows:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Concatenate contents from multiple cells using square brackets"
[ca{2:3}]
```

```matlab title="result"
ans =

    1     2     3  
```

This syntax just jams all of the numeric values into one numeric array. Which may be what you want. But not always.

Consider the names90 cell array that we created at the top of this module

```matlab linenums="1"
names90s = {'Jessica'; 'Ashley'; 'Emily'; 'Samantha'}
```

We can extract contents from all cells as a comma-separated list using the following syntax

```matlab linenums="1" title="Extract All Content as comma-separated list"
names90{:} % extract all elements
```

```matlab
ans =

    'Jessica'


ans =

    'Ashley'


ans =

    'Emily'


ans =

    'Samantha'
```

But if we try to concatenate this content using the square brackets‚Ä¶

```matlab linenums="1" title="Extract and Concatenate"
[names90{:}] % note the square brackets 
```

```matlab title="result"
ans =

    'JessicaAshleyEmilySamantha'
```

‚Ä¶We get all of the content crammed into one character array, which may not be what we want, especially since there is no separation between the names.

Similarly, notice that there is no easy way to concatenate cells 4 and 5 since those contents have different dimensions.

```matlab linenums="1" title="Extracting and Concatenating Disparate content returns error"
[ca{4:5}]
```

```text title="result"
Error using horzcat
Dimensions of arrays being concatenated are not consistent.
```

Since you can put *anything* in each cell of the array, you can't easily extract and concatenate the content from multiple cells‚Äîthe syntax can get convoluted to get what you want.

!!! note "Cell Indexing Takeaways"

    **The Main Takeaway**: that indexing with `( )` returns smaller cell arrays while indexing with `{ }` returns the contents from the elements inside the cell arrays, sometimes in unexpected ways. Always keep these two different types of syntaxes in mind when indexing cell arrays.
    
    **But, really, the main takeaway is that cell array indexing can be a major source of syntax errors and hair-pulling frustration and should be avoided if at all possible!** That is, use other variable class types whenever possible or only put similar items in the elements of a cell array.

#### Challenge: Cell Indexing

=== "Question 1"

    Show the syntax to index the last three elements in *`ca`* to get back a smaller cell array. What do you get?
=== "Answer 1"

    ```matlab linenums="1"
    ca(4:end)
    ```

    ```matlab title="result"
    ans =

    3√ó1 cell array

      {[      1 0]}
      {2√ó2 logical}
      {0√ó0 double }
    ```
    You get a 3X1 cell array with the last three cells. 

=== "Question 2"

    Show the syntax to index out the contents from cell 3. What do you get?
=== "Answer 2"

    ```matlab linenums="1"
    ca{3}
    ```

    ```matlab title="result"
    ans =

     2     3
    ```
    You get a 2X1 numeric vector . 

---

## Cell Arrays and Functions

 Since the actually data in a cell array is packaged into cells, you need to take care when inputting cell arrays into functions. This is a major potential source of syntax errors. Many functions expect the contents from cells in the cell array, not the cell array itself.

### Improper Inputting of Cells into Functions

Consider our cell array, *`ca`*:

```matlab title="ca"
6√ó1 cell array

    {'Ab'       }
    {[        1]}
    {[      2 3]}
    {[      1 0]}
    {2√ó2 logical}
    {0√ó0 double }
```

Say, we want to add up the contents from the second and third cells using the function **`sum`**. If we don't index correctly, we will get an error:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Indexing with Parentheses Returns error"
sum(ca(2:3))
```

```text
Error using sum
Invalid data type. First argument must be numeric or
logical.
```

‚Ä¶This error means that the function **sum** does not accept cell arrays as inputs. Remember, since we indexed with parentheses, we got a smaller cell array back.

If we instead use the curly brackets to access the contents‚Ä¶

```matlab linenums="1" title="Indexing with Curly Brackets may not work properly in functions"
sum(ca{2:3})
```

‚Ä¶We get a result‚Ä¶

```matlab
ans =

     1
```

‚Ä¶But not the correct result. We just get the sum of the first cell, which contains the value 1. This is because using curly brackets on multiple cells of a cell array returns a comma-separate list. When that happens, the function **sum** just uses the first output.

The correct syntax to correctly sum cells 2 and 3 is as follows:

```matlab linenums="1" title="Correct Input into sum"
sum([ca{2:3}])
```

```matlab title="result"
ans =

     6
```

Notice that we needed to first index using the curly brackets and then concatenate the output using the square brackets. Finally, we get the right result.

So, as you can see, there are some issues with indexing cell arrays. As we'll see in later modules, there are different complex variable types to help tackle these issues.

---

### cellfun - Putting the Fun Back in Cell Arrays

The function **`cellfun`** was built to methodically extract the contents from each element in a cell array, perform an operation on those contents (like a function), and then return the output from that operation.

Take for example, the function **numel**, which returns the number of elements in an array. If we plug our cell array into **numel**‚Ä¶

```matlab linenums="1"
numel(ca)
```

```matlab
ans =

     6
```
‚Ä¶ we get `6`, which is the number of cells in *`ca`*. But what if we wanted to know how many elements are in each array contained in the cells of *`ca`*? This is where the function **cellfun** comes in handy.

!!! example "Using cellfun to count the number of elements in each cell of a cell array."

    To get the number of elements in each array found in *`ca`*, we use the following syntax

    ```matlab linenums="1"
    counts = cellfun(@numel, ca)
    ```

    ```matlab title="result"
    ans =

     2
     1
     2
     2
     4
     0
    ```

    ‚Ä¶Perfect, now we get the element count for each cell in *`ca`*. Recall that the last cell in *`ca`* was empty.    

    Let's unpack the syntax a little further:

    1. The first input into **`cellfun`** is the *handle* to the function **`numel`**. A handle is simply the function name preceded by the `@` symbol. This directs **`cellfun`** to use the function **`numel`** as an input (instead of first trying to execute that function and using the output from that function as an input).
    2. The second input into **`cellfun`** is the cell array
    3. The output from **`cellfun`** returns the action of **numel** on each cell of *`ca`*. This output is similar to repeated calls to **numel** as follows:

    ```matlab
    numel(ca{1}) % number of elements in cell 1
    numel(ca{2}) % number of elements in cell 2
    numel(ca{3}) % number of elements in cell 3
    ```

The function **cellfun** greatly simplifies performing operations on cells in a cell array. Sometimes, though, the function that we want to use doesn't return a tidy output, like a single number, which can then be packaged into a numeric array. What if we wanted to know the class of each array contained in the cells of the cell array? Class names, like 'Char' and 'Double', vary by length, so they must be stored in&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;another cell array. To tell **cellfun** to output a cell array, we  add a couple of inputs, as follows:

```matlab linenums="1" title="cellfun with UniformOutput set to false"
cellfun(@class,ca,'UniformOutput',false)
```

```matlab title="result"
ans =

  6√ó1 cell array

    {'char'   }
    {'double' }
    {'double' }
    {'logical'}
    {'logical'}
    {'double' }
```

‚Ä¶and we get the output nicely packaged in a cell array

---

## Post-mortem

1. Cell arrays are great for organizing disparate information of different dimensions

2. Cell arrays are less great for getting that disparate information back out again.

3. Watch what you input into functions when cell arrays are involved. If you get an error, you probably messed up the indexing.
