# Functions

!!! abstract "*For doing stuff*"

## Stuff You Should Know

* That a function does stuff with variables
* That there are a lot of functions
* How to find built-in MATLAB functions
* How to call functions using the proper syntax.

## Useful-ish MATLAB Documentation

* [Calling Functions](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/learn_matlab/calling-functions.html)

## So, What is a Function?

A function takes the data from a variable and does stuff. Think of a function as a list of instructions typically designed to manipulate the inputted data in some fashion. If you want to get fancy, you can call it a [sub-routine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) or an algorithm. Often, these programming instructions are hidden from the user, so you can think of a function a little like a black box.

The MATLAB syntax used to call a function looks like this:

```matlab
output = name_of_function(input_variable)
```

Notice that you will typically find the function on the right side of the equal sign. This is because a function typically (but not always) returns data that you can then stash into a variable.

## Getting Help on Functions

MATLAB has thousands of built-in functions to perform almost any basic task you can think of. So, sometimes the hardest part is:

1. Finding the right function to do exactly what you are looking for
2. Writing the proper syntax to call that function.

The MATLAB built-in documentation is a great place to start. You can find the available MATLAB functions and the proper syntax for calling those functions using the built-in documentation.

If you can't find it in the MATLAB documentation, then you can search the internet for MATLAB functions. There are a lot out there on MATLAB. When in doubt, *Google*. I typically preface my Google searches as follows:

```matlab
google matlab "thing I want to do"
```

Of course, now that we are living in the future, you can also use ChatGPT. Your student CU Anschutz credentials give you access to the latest version of ChatGPT through  [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com). Be sure to sign in to use the full version. The Mathworks even provides a [MATLAB ChatGPT Playground](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/playground/new) specifically for MATLAB. This might be the best place to start for using ChatGPT to answer your MATLAB-related questions.
