# Basic Data

A good deal of what we will be doing as we muddle through MATLAB is entering or loading data.

But what data?

Well, we'll start with the data that you can enter using your keyboard. This type of data can be broken down into three categories:

1. Numbers
2. Characters
3. Booleans (true or false)

That's it. All the data that we are going to store in variables as we muddle through programming can be whittled down to these three data types.

Notice that this page is filled with these data types. There are characters everywhere, including letters, spaces, and punctuation. There are numbers in the numbered list above. And, there is even a boolean at the top of the page. That little switch ( :material-toggle-switch: ), next to the Search Bar, is a little on/off switch that be changed to indicate True/False. When it's true, it shows the light mode, when it's false, it shows the dark mode.
