# Data Processing

Now that we have learned to package our data into variables, we are going to start to process that data. Data processing is the art of turning raw, messy data into something usefulâ€”kind of like turning unpeeled potatoes into french fries. It involves collecting, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data so it can be used for decision-making, research, or  machine learning.

In this section, we'll muddle our way through some basic data processing, including some stats and data visualization using MATLAB.
