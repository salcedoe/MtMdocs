Once you have created your different folders of image sequences in Slicer, open the Apple QuickTime Player (v10.5 or greater) and follow these steps

1. From the **File** menu, select “Open Image Sequence…”
2. Select one of the folders that you just created that contains a Slicer Image Series
3. Use the following settings in the pop-up dialog
   - Resolution: `Actual size`
   - **Frame Rate:** `30 Frames Per Second`
   - **Encode For:** `Greater Compatibility`

Your image sequences should come up in quicktime as a video.

To export the video, select the “File:Export As…” menu item and select `1080p`.

Import these saved video clips into iMovie.
