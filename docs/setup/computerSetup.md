## Turn on File Extensions

A file extension identifies the type of file and is typically part of a file name. The extension follows a period in the name. For example, a PDF file might be called something like

`CoolStuff.pdf`

In this file, `CoolStuff` is the file name and `.pdf` is the file extensions. Other common file extensions that you might encounter include:

- **.DOCX**: a Microsoft Word Document
- **.CSV**: a Spreadsheet file
- **.PNG**: an Image File

`CoolStuff.docx` is a different document than `CoolStuff.pdf` and should be opened by Microsoft Word.

Often by default, an Operating System will hide these extensions so that  the two files `CoolStuff.pdf` and `CoolStuff.docx` would be listed in the same folder as:

- `CoolStuff`
- `CoolStuff`

This can be confusing! Also, in programming, you need to know the file extension to properly open the file.

So, make sure that you can can see the file extensions of your files. This will make working with files much easier and your journey into programming simpler.
