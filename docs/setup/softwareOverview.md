# Software and Sites

As we muddle through Medical Imaging, we will be using the following software:

## Artificial Intelligence

We'll also play around with that new, fandangled AI everyone's been talking about.

- **Microsoft Copilot Chat**: Students at CU Anschutz can use the Microsoft Copilot version for maximum free usage (included with CU Anschutz credentials). The easiest way to use this AI is to open the Microsoft Teams desktop app and click on the Copilot Icon ([More info on OIT](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/office-of-information-technology/tools-services/microsoft--copilot))
