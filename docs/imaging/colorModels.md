# Color Models

!!! note "Definition"

    Color Models are abstract mathematical models to represent colors.

## RGB Colors

- Based on how we see color using three different cones.

- All color is represented by the combination of three colors: Red, Green, and Blue.

### HSL / HSV

[HSL and HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) are representations of the RGB color model as a cylinder with Hue, Saturation, and Lightness/Value axes.

## L\*a\*b\* Colors

The [CIELAB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space), also referred to as L*a*b*, is a color space designed to create reproducible representations of color. CIELAB expresses color as a combination of perceptual lightness and 4 human colors: red, green, blue and yellow.

CIELAB values

- L\* for perceptual lightness
- a\* for the red-green scale
- b\* for the blue-yellow scale
