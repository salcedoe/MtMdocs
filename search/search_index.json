It tells us the chances of being wrong. When we repeat an experiment, we almost never get exactly the same results. Instead, repeated measurements span a range of values due to biological variability and the precision limits of measuring equipment. But if our measurements are going to be different each time, how do we determine whether a measurement in a given sample is truly different or just randomly different?</p> <p>Answer: we use statistics. Specifically, we use hypothesis testing to determine how likely two samples are different: it's a probabilities outcome, not a definite YES/NO result.</p> <p>Hypothesis testing involves making assumptions: either there IS or there IS NOT a statistical difference between the samples.

With a <code>0.05</code> p-value, we assume two samples are just random variations from the same population (Null Hypothesis), unless that variation would only happen in 5% of the cases or fewer. If the calculated p-value of the sample difference is smaller than <code>0.05</code>, then we reject the Null Hypothesis and accept the Alternative Hypothesis.

Five out of a hundred times is also one out of twenty times and that happens more often than you would think. If you are doing a lot of hypotheses testing, then you may need to adjust your p-value to take this into consideration. For example, if you are testing twenty different things using a <code>0.05</code> p-value, one of things you are testing may just randomly fall below the p-value criteria because thats how randomness works. There are many ways to adjust the p-value depending on the number of sample comparisons, including the Bonferonni correction or the False Discovery Rate.

The p-value doesn't actually do that.  Imagine that you have a coin that you suspect is weighted toward heads. Your null hypothesis is that the coin is fair. You flip it 100 times and get more heads than tails. The p-value won\u2019t tell you whether the coin is fair, but it will tell you the probability that you\u2019d get at least as many heads as you did if the coin was fair. That\u2019s it \u2014 nothing more. Believing that a low p-value definitively tells you that the coin is unfair is known as the prosecutor's fallacy. (1)</p> <ol> <li>Adapted from: FiveThirtyEight - Not Even Scientists Can Easily Explain P-values</li> </ol> <p>And remember, this whole process is based on making assumptions. If your hypothesis was pretty unlikely to start with, getting a p-value of 0.05 or even 0.01, doesn't necessarily prove the hypothesis (e.g. covid vaccination is ineffective), it simply reports the probabilities of getting the results that you got, and that perhaps your hypothesis deserves another look.

Nature 506, 150\u2013152 (2014)</li> </ol> <p>The Prosecutor's Fallacy</p> <p>The danger of hypothesis testing is sometimes you can get really low p-values, even when the real effect has a very low probability. Say you want to test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. One way to test its effectiveness might be to simply compare the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people who are hospitalized with COVID-19. Using hypothesis testing, you likely will find a significantly larger number of people who were vaccinated and hospitalized. Based on this result, and a low p-value, you may be tempted to conclude that the vaccine is ineffective and somehow makes you more susceptive to being hospitalized. However, as the diagram below illustrates, this fails to take into consideration the large difference in the total number of people who are vaccinated vs those who are unvaccinated. In this exaggerated example, we have far more vaccinated people (in pink) vs unvaccinated people (in green): 100 to 10. So, 10 times more people are vaccinated than unvaccinated. Since there are so few unvaccinated people, even if a high percentage of these people get sick, you still get a small number of people. In this example,  50% of the 10 unvaccinated people got hospitalized, so you get 5 people hospitalized. By comparison, since the number of vaccinated people is much higher, even a small percentage of this populate will result in a larger number. In this example, just 10% of the vaccinated people were hospitalized, which is 10 people \u2014 twice as many as the unvaccinated people who were hospitalized. So, even though its a much smaller percentage of the total population, you get twice as many vaccinated people than unvaccinated people hospitalized in this exaggerated example. The reality was more subtle than this, but still striking. We know the vaccine effectiveness range is roughly 90-95%, meaning if 100 unvaccinated people get hospitalized, 5 vaccinated people would be hospitalized. Considering the larger percentage of people who got vaccinated during the pandemic (in the 80% range), it was highly probable there would be more vaccinated than unvaccinated people that were hospitalized (and this actually happened). Again, it is simply a numbers game.</p> <p></p> <p>Adapted from: Base Rate Fallacy with Vaccines</p>"},{"location":"dataProcessing/HypTesting/#hypothesis-testing-in-matlab","title":"Hypothesis Testing in MATLAB","text":"<p>Hypothesis testing isn't always just testing whether samples are different.

Well, we could just draw a line on the moon, using the `imageViewer app.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown here, Image Viewer has a \"Measure Distance\" tool, which we can use to measure distances in pixel on an image.

Another, more robust method that doesn't require user input would be to calculate the diameter from the area.

Shape options include circles, ellipses, polygons, lines, and others.</p> <p>The following example code activates the Circle ROI tool, allowing you to draw a circle around the moon and create your very first ROI.

If your circle is too large or too small, simply click on one of the four vertices to resize the circle. As you can see in the right panel in the above image, we have successfully segmented (or masked) our moon.</p> <p>Notice that the handle <code>roi</code> has the cube icon () in the workspace. This identifies the variable as an object. An object is kind of like a variable/function combo.

The callback function is the function that is called when the button is pressed.  <code>gbcf</code> is a function that points to the current figure, so <code>delete(gcbf)</code> deletes the current figure. Once you delete the figure, everything inside of the figure is deleted as well, including the button. So, this acts kind of like a self-destruct function.

Well, in fact, we have, and this method is called Otsu's Method (so, technically Otsu came up with this method). This algorithm assumes that an image contains two classes of pixels (background and foreground pixels) and it then calculates a threshold that best separates these pixels based on the image's histogram. Note, there are other algorithms out there, but Otsu's is one of the most commonly used algorithms for thresholding.

So keep that in mind.</p> <p>Now that we have a cut-off value, we simply need to run the logical operation. However, since the cut-off value is a double class while the image is still a <code>uint8</code> class, we need to rescale the cutoff to the 8-bit class range before proceeding. The function  <code>im2uint8</code> simplifies this:</p> Convert value to double<pre><code>cutoff = im2uint8(cutoff)\n</code></pre> result<pre><code>cutoff =\n\n  uint8\n\n   70\n</code></pre> <p>\u2026The cutoff variable is now a class <code>uint8</code> and its value falls in the 0-255 range. 70 seems a little high, considering most space pixels appeared to have a value of 0, but we'll try it anyway.</p> <p>As before, we'll use a logical relational operation to create a binary image and then use the function <code>imshowpair</code> with a third input of 'montage' to display the original image and the mask side by side:</p> Threshold using Otsu's method<pre><code>mask = moon2&gt;cutoff; % create mask\nimshowpair(moon2, mask,'montage') % display original and mask, side by side\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>And\u2026the segmentation sort of works.

Its wave characteristics are not pronounced in such situations, so you can totally think of light traveling like a laser beam. There are three ways in which light can travel from a source to another location. It can come directly from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Or light can travel through various media, such as air and glass, to the observer. Light can also arrive after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all of these cases, we can model the path of light as a straight line called a ray.</p> <p></p> <p>Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth, traveling through empty space directly from the source. (b) Light can reach a person by traveling through media like air and glass. (c) Light can also reflect from an object like a mirror. In the situations shown here, light interacts with objects large enough that it travels in straight lines, like a ray.</p> <p>When light encounters and interacts with materials, it changes direction. Since light moves in a straight line, like a laser, it's path can be described by simple trigonometry (geometric optics). Two laws govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter. These are the law of reflection, for situations in which light bounces off matter, and the law of refraction, for situations in which light passes through matter.</p>"},{"location":"imaging/electromagneticRadiation/#refraction","title":"Refraction","text":"<p>When light encounters a new medium (e.g. from air to glass), it bends. This bend is known as refraction, and its the same angle going backwards and forwards.</p> <p></p> <p>The change in direction of a light ray depends on how the index of refraction changes when it crosses from one medium to another. In the situations shown here, the index of refraction is greater in medium 2 than in medium 1. (a) A ray of light moves closer to the perpendicular when entering a medium with a higher index of refraction. (b) A ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when entering a medium with a lower index of refraction.</p> <p>Refraction depends on how fast light travels. We all know that the speed of light in a vacuum \\(c\\) is \\(3.00\u00d7108m/s\\). This is the fastest known speed in the universe. What we may not remember is that light travels slower when it passes through matter. This is because light interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, since its interaction varies with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures. </p> <p>The index of refraction is a constant used to describe the speed of light in a given material. We define this index, \\(n\\), as follows:</p> \\[n=\\frac{c}{v}\\] <p>So, the index of refraction (\\(n\\)) is just  a ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (\\(c\\)) to the speed of light in matter (\\(v\\)). The higher the index, the lower the light is traveling in the medium, and the greater the bend in the light. For example, light travels nearly half as fast in a diamond (\\(n=2\\)), which makes the light bend more and is what makes diamonds all sparkly. Zircon has an \\(n = 1.5\\), so, less bend and less sparkle. And air has an \\(n = 1.000293\\), so barely any reduction in speed and hardly any bend. But its there, if you look for it.</p> <p>The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or Snell\u2019s law, after the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell (1591\u20131626), who discovered it in 1621.

The bony orbits surround the eyeballs, protecting them and anchoring the soft tissues of the eye (Figure 14.13). The eyelids, with lashes at their leading edges, help to protect the eye from abrasions by blocking particles that may land on the surface of the eye. The inner surface of each lid is a thin membrane known as the palpebral conjunctiva. The conjunctiva extends over the white areas of the eye (the sclera), connecting the eyelids to the eyeball. Tears are produced by the lacrimal gland, located just inside the orbit, superior and lateral to the eyeball. Tears produced by this gland flow through the lacrimal duct to the medial corner of the eye, where the tears flow over the conjunctiva, washing away foreign particles.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 14.13. The Eye in the Orbit. The eye is located within the orbit and surrounded by soft tissues that protect and support its function. The orbit is surrounded by cranial bones of the skull.</p> <p>The eye itself is a hollow sphere composed of three layers of tissue. The outermost layer is the fibrous tunic, which includes the white sclera and clear cornea. The sclera accounts for five sixths of the surface of the eye, most of which is not visible, though humans are unique compared with many other species in having so much of the \u201cwhite of the eye\u201d visible (Figure 14.15). The transparent cornea covers the anterior tip of the eye and allows light to enter the eye. The middle layer of the eye is the vascular tunic, which is mostly composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. The choroid is a layer of highly vascularized connective tissue that provides a blood supply to the eyeball. The choroid is posterior to the ciliary body, a muscular structure that is attached to the lens by suspensory ligaments, or zonule fibers. These two structures bend the lens, allowing it to focus light on the back of the eye. Overlaying the ciliary body, and visible in the anterior eye, is the iris\u2014the colored part of the eye. The iris is a smooth muscle that opens or closes the pupil, which is the hole at the center of the eye that allows light to enter. The iris constricts the pupil in response to bright light and dilates the pupil in response to dim light. The innermost layer of the eye is the neural tunic, or retina, which contains the nervous tissue responsible for photoreception.</p> <p>The eye is also divided into two cavities: the anterior cavity and the posterior cavity. The anterior cavity is the space between the cornea and lens, including the iris and ciliary body. It is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humor. The posterior cavity is the space behind the lens that extends to the posterior side of the interior eyeball, where the retina is located. The posterior cavity is filled with a more viscous fluid called the vitreous humor.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 14.15. Structure of the Eye. The sphere of the eye can be divided into anterior and posterior chambers. The wall of the eye is composed of three layers: the fibrous tunic, vascular tunic, and neural tunic.

The center of the retina has a small indentation known as the fovea.</p>"},{"location":"imaging/humanVision/#retina","title":"Retina","text":"<p>The retina is composed of several layers and contains specialized cells for the initial processing of visual stimuli. The photoreceptors (rods and cones) change their membrane potential when stimulated by light energy. The change in membrane potential alters the amount of neurotransmitter that the photoreceptor cells release onto bipolar cells in the outer synaptic layer. It is the bipolar cell in the retina that connects a photoreceptor to a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) in the inner synaptic layer. There, amacrine cells additionally contribute to retinal processing before an action potential is produced by the RGC. The axons of RGCs, which lie at the innermost layer of the retina, collect at the optic disc and leave the eye as the optic nerve (see Figure 14.15). Because these axons pass through the retina, there are no photoreceptors at the very back of the eye, where the optic nerve begins. This creates a \u201cblind spot\u201d in the retina, and a corresponding blind spot in our visual field.</p> <p>Note that the photoreceptors in the retina (rods and cones) are located behind the axons, RGCs, bipolar cells, and retinal blood vessels. A significant amount of light is absorbed by these structures before the light reaches the photoreceptor cells. However, at the exact center of the retina is a small area known as the fovea. At the fovea, the retina lacks the supporting cells and blood vessels, and only contains photoreceptors. Therefore, visual acuity, or the sharpness of vision, is greatest at the fovea. This is because the fovea is where the least amount of incoming light is absorbed by other retinal structures (see Figure 14.15). As one moves in either direction from this central point of the retina, visual acuity drops significantly. In addition, each photoreceptor cell of the fovea is connected to a single RGC. Therefore, this RGC does not have to integrate inputs from multiple photoreceptors, which reduces the accuracy of visual transduction. Toward the edges of the retina, several photoreceptors converge on RGCs (through the bipolar cells) up to a ratio of 50 to 1. The difference in visual acuity between the fovea and peripheral retina is easily evidenced by looking directly at a word in the middle of this paragraph. The visual stimulus in the middle of the field of view falls on the fovea and is in the sharpest focus. Without moving your eyes off that word, notice that words at the beginning or end of the paragraph are not in focus. The images in your peripheral vision are focused by the peripheral retina, and have vague, blurry edges and words that are not as clearly identified. As a result, a large part of the neural function of the eyes is concerned with moving the eyes and head so that important visual stimuli are centered on the fovea.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 14.16.

There are two types of photoreceptors\u2014rods and cones\u2014which differ in the shape of their outer segment.

(credit: modification of work by Piotr Sliwa)</p> <p>There are three cone photopigments, called opsins, which are each sensitive to a particular wavelength of light. The wavelength of visible light determines its color. The pigments in human eyes are specialized in perceiving three different primary colors: red, green, and blue.</p> <p>At the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell. A single unit of light is called a photon, which is described in physics as a packet of energy with properties of both a particle and a wave. The energy of a photon is represented by its wavelength, with each wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular color. Visible light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 and 720 nm. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation longer than 720 nm fall into the infrared range, whereas wavelengths shorter than 380 nm fall into the ultraviolet range. Light with a wavelength of 380 nm is blue whereas light with a wavelength of 720 nm is dark red. All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.</p> <p>Opsin pigments are actually transmembrane proteins that contain a cofactor known as retinal. Retinal is a hydrocarbon molecule related to vitamin A. When a photon hits retinal, the long hydrocarbon chain of the molecule is biochemically altered. Specifically, photons cause some of the double-bonded carbons within the chain to switch from a cis to a trans conformation. This process is called photoisomerization. Before interacting with a photon, retinal\u2019s flexible double-bonded carbons are in the cis conformation. This molecule is referred to as 11-cis-retinal. A photon interacting with the molecule causes the flexible double-bonded carbons to change to the trans- conformation, forming all-trans-retinal, which has a straight hydrocarbon chain (Figure 14.17).</p> <p>The shape change of retinal in the photoreceptors initiates visual transduction in the retina. Activation of retinal and the opsin proteins result in activation of a G protein. The G protein changes the membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell, which then releases less neurotransmitter into the outer synaptic layer of the retina. Until the retinal molecule is changed back to the 11-cis-retinal shape, the opsin cannot respond to light energy, which is called bleaching. When a large group of photopigments is bleached, the retina will send information as if opposing visual information is being perceived. After a bright flash of light, afterimages are usually seen in negative. The photoisomerization is reversed by a series of enzymatic changes so that the retinal responds to more light energy.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 14.17. Retinal Isomers. The retinal molecule has two isomers, (a) one before a photon interacts with it and (b) one that is altered through photoisomerization.</p> <p>The opsins are sensitive to limited wavelengths of light. Rhodopsin, the photopigment in rods, is most sensitive to light at a wavelength of 498 nm. The three color opsins have peak sensitivities of 564 nm, 534 nm, and 420 nm corresponding roughly to the primary colors of red, green, and blue (Figure 14.18). The absorbance of rhodopsin in the rods is much more sensitive than in the cone opsins; specifically, rods are sensitive to vision in low light conditions, and cones are sensitive to brighter conditions. In normal sunlight, rhodopsin will be constantly bleached while the cones are active. In a darkened room, there is not enough light to activate cone opsins, and vision is entirely dependent on rods. Rods are so sensitive to light that a single photon can result in an action potential from a rod\u2019s corresponding RGC.</p>"},{"location":"imaging/humanVision/#trichromatic-color-vision","title":"Trichromatic Color Vision","text":"<p>There are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most responsive, as shown in Figure 14.18.

Actually, normal vision should be called \u201cideal\u201d vision because nearly one-half of the human population requires some sort of eyesight correction, so requiring glasses is by no means \u201cabnormal.\u201d Image formation by our eyes and common vision correction can be analyzed with the optics discussed earlier in this chapter.</p> <p>Figure 2.6.1 shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina, which lies a fixed distance from the lens. The flexible lens of the eye allows it to adjust the radius of curvature of the lens to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. The variable opening (i.e., the pupil) of the eye, along with chemical adaptation, allows the eye to detect light intensities from the lowest observable to \\(10^{10}\\) times greater (without damage). This is an incredible range of detection. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys the signals received by the eye to the brain.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure  2.6.1. The cornea and lens of the eye act together to form a real image on the light-sensing retina, which has its densest concentration of receptors in the fovea and a blind spot over the optic nerve.

Layers of tissues with varying indices of refraction in the lens are shown here. However, they have been omitted from other pictures for clarity.</p> <p>The indices of refraction in the eye are crucial to its ability to form images. Table  2.6.1  lists the indices of refraction relevant to the eye. The biggest change in the index of refraction, which is where the light rays are most bent, occurs at the air-cornea interface rather than at the aqueous humor-lens interface. The ray diagram in Figure  2.6.2  shows image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The cornea, which is itself a converging lens with a focal length of approximately 2.3 cm, provides most of the focusing power of the eye. The lens, which is a converging lens with a focal length of about 6.4 cm, provides the finer focus needed to produce a clear image on the retina. The cornea and lens can be treated as a single thin lens, even though the light rays pass through several layers of material (such as cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the lens, and vitreous humor), changing direction at each interface. The image formed is much like the one produced by a single convex lens (i.e., a real, inverted image). Although images formed in the eye are inverted, the brain inverts them once more to make them seem upright.</p> <p>Table  2.6.1 : Refractive Indices Relevant to the Eye.</p> Material Index of Refraction Water 1.33 Air 1.0 Cornea 1.38 Aqueous humor 1.34 Lens 1.41* Vitreous humor 1.34 <p>*This is an average value.

The distance to the object is not to scale.</p> <p>As noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision\u2014that is, the image distance di must equal the lens-to-retina distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, the image distance di must be the same for objects at all distances. The ciliary muscles adjust the shape of the eye lens for focusing on nearby or far objects. By changing the shape of the eye lens, the eye changes the focal length of the lens. This mechanism of the eye is called accommodation.</p> <p>The nearest point an object can be placed so that the eye can form a clear image on the retina is called the near point of the eye. Similarly, the far point is the farthest distance at which an object is clearly visible. A person with normal vision can see objects clearly at distances ranging from 25 cm to essentially infinity.

Typical vision defects are easy to understand with geometric optics, and some are simple to correct. Figure  2.6.3  illustrates two common vision defects. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the ability to see near objects, whereas distant objects are blurry. The eye over converges the nearly parallel rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina for a clear image. The distance to the farthest object that can be seen clearly is called the far point of the eye (normally the far point is at infinity). Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the ability to see far objects clearly, whereas near objects are blurry. A farsighted eye does not sufficiently converge the rays from a near object to make the rays meet on the retina.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure  2.6.3. (a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina, so they have diverged when they strike the retina, producing a blurry image. An eye lens that is too powerful can cause nearsightedness, or the eye may be too long. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object on the retina, producing blurry near-field vision. An eye lens with insufficient optical power or an eye that is too short can cause farsightedness.</p>"},{"location":"imaging/humanVision/#nearsighted-correction","title":"Nearsighted correction","text":"<p>Since the nearsighted eye over converges light rays, the correction for nearsightedness consists of placing a diverging eyeglass lens in front of the eye, as shown in Figure  2.6.4. This reduces the optical power of an eye that is too powerful (recall that the focal length of a diverging lens is negative, so its optical power is negative). Another way to understand this correction is that a diverging lens will cause the incoming rays to diverge more to compensate for the excessive convergence caused by the lens system of the eye. The image produced by the diverging eyeglass lens serves as the (optical) object for the eye, and because the eye cannot focus on objects beyond its far point, the diverging lens must form an image of distant (physical) objects at a point that is closer than the far point.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure  2.6.4. Correction of nearsightedness requires a diverging lens that compensates for over convergence by the eye. The diverging lens produces an image closer to the eye than the physical object.

By comparison, in a base-10 system\u2014the one we all learned in kindergarten\u2014there are 10 symbols (that we call digits): 0, 1, 2,...9.</p> <p>In a binary system (like a computer), you use only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all numeric values (and, by extension, letters, words and all other information). For example, <code>01101001</code> is binary for the numeric value of 105.</p> <p>Binary numbers are often clustered in groups of 8 digits (see next section). From right to left, each position in this cluster has an equivalent bit-number, starting from 0, that indicates increasing powers of 2:</p> <p></p> <p>The bit on the farthest right corresponds to \\(2^0\\), while the bit on the farthest left (in this example) corresponds to \\(2^7\\). To create any numeric value, you need to create an equation that contains these powers of 2. Consider the following:</p> <pre><code>3 = 2 + 1\n3 = 2^1 +  2^0\n</code></pre> <p>In this equation we have a <code>2</code> to the power of <code>1</code> and a <code>2</code> to the power of <code>0</code>, which correspond to the first two bit positions. In binary, this would be written as <code>11</code>. Although, often binary is written in chunks of eight digits, so:  <code>0000 0011</code>.</p> <p>The following table shows the binary representation of a series of decimal numbers, in 8-digit chunks:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"matlabBasics/BinaryNumbers/#challenge-0","title":"Challenge 0","text":"Write the power of 2 equation for the numeric value 4 and display the value <code>4</code> in binary. <p>Power of 2 Equation</p> <pre><code>4 = 2^2 + 0 + 0 \n</code></pre> <p>Display 4 in binary</p> <p>`0000 0100'</p> <p>\u2026binary is often prefaced with zeros </p> What does the MATLAB function dec2bin do?

So we already figured out how to store numbers, characters, and booleans in arrays (review the Basic Data Class modules if you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about).

These three variable types can hold pretty much any type of information that we need.</p> <p>So, why do we need to learn about other variable types?</p> <p>Well, while very useful, the fundamental data types have certain restrictions that at times can become onerous for use at scale. For example, when storing rows of characters in a character array (i.e. a character matrix), you need to pad the array with empty spaces so that the number of columns is the same across all rows in the character matrix. This gets complicated when you are trying to store a series of characters, like names.</p> <p>Now, the function <code>char</code> can simplify  this process.</p> <p>Example: Using char to pad character matrices</p> <p>In this example, we will store a series of Girls Names that were popular in the 90's (ok, millennial)</p> <pre><code>common_names_1995 = char('Jessica', 'Ashley', 'Emily', 'Samantha')\n</code></pre> result<pre><code>common_names_1995 =\n                    4\u00d78 char array\n                    'Jessica '\n                    'Ashley  '\n                    'Emily   '\n                    'Samantha'\n</code></pre> <p>Note the varying number of spaces added after each name, save for the longest name, 'Samantha'</p> <p>But, while <code>char</code> easily manages the padding,  we would need to run this function every time we want to add a new row to the character array, which can get computationally burdensome (a fancy way of saying slow). Not to mention the fact that adding extra spaces to each row of a character array can make things tricky if you need to know the length of each character array. Say, for example, you wanted to know the average length of popular names in 1995. You would have to come up with a method to exclude those extraneous spaces in your count. This is certainly doable but adds unnecessary steps to the procedure.</p>"},{"location":"matlabBasics/Cell/#cell-arrays-to-the-rescue","title":"Cell Arrays to the Rescue","text":"<p>Cell arrays solve these problems by eliminating the need for a single value (number, character, or boolean) in each element of the array.

If your bank account is less than the amount of the hoverboard, then you recalculate the bank  balance and hoverboard price until you have more money in your bank account than the updated price of the hoverboard.

While this works satisfactorily for a small dataset, you run the risk of running into memory problems for  very large datasets if you do not preallocate the table.

And then suddenly, it clicks, and you're smoking and chatting away with your new friends in Italy.</p>"},{"location":"matlabBasics/MatlabIntro/#so-what-is-programming-anyway","title":"So, what is programming, anyway?","text":"<p>Computer programming is primarily a written language where you write a sequence of words and phrases to tell a computer what to do. And like all written languages, there are specific rules on the order of the words, the spacing, and the punctuation. These rules are called syntax. And syntax matters, critically. Turns out that your English teacher was right.</p> <p>The biggest hurdle to learning computer programming is getting the syntax just right. This is also the source of most frustration.</p> <p>Violent Syntax</p> <p>Consider the following fairly innocuous sentence:</p> <p>The Panda eats shoots &amp; leaves.</p> <p></p> <p>\u2026Here, the panda is enjoying a nice, leafy meal.</p> <p>But the meaning of the sentence changes violently with the addition of a single comma:</p> <p>The Panda eats, shoots &amp; leaves</p> <p></p> <p>\u2026Now the Panda is a wanted criminal and on the run. </p> <p>See Lynne Truss's book \"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\" for more such delightful examples in the English language.</p> <p>Bottom line: Computers are dumb and don't get nuance. If you say something just a little wrong, the programming language will fail until you state your command in the precise way that the computer was expecting.

MATLAB stands for MATrix-LABoratory. A matrix is a data type similar to a spreadsheet. Matrices are in fact the main data structure of digital images (We'll get into what a data structure means soon, but for now just roll with it). MATLAB is very good at handling matrices, which is one of the reasons why we are learning this language in the first place. MATLAB also has excellent documentation and a great integrated development environment that simplifies the learning process.</p> <p>Now, you may hear some people malign the choice of MATLAB. Why aren't you learning Python, Java, or some other flavor of the month? Ignore these people. They likely don't have an academic license for MATLAB like we do. And MATLAB includes some nice tools to help soothe the pain of learning programming. Plus, it really doesn't matter what language you use to learn computer programming because, in the end, it is all just syntax. Just like it is easier to learn Italian after learning how to speak Spanish, learning MATLAB makes it easier to learn other programming languages. And, beyond MATLAB, learning programming will give you the foundation to understand the digital underpinnings of other data analysis software so that when you learn new software, even if there is no programming involved, you will be primed to more quickly understand how the software works and how to get the most out of that software.</p> <p>What so bad about Excel?</p> <p>One of the reasons that we are learning a programming language like MATLAB is that spreadsheets, like those created by Excel, are infamously known to be riddled with errors, especially complex spreadsheets with lots of formulas. Such formulas are hard to track, especially when there are a lot of cells and it's easy to make mistakes. Even worse, just opening an excel file can create issues. Consider the example discussed in this article, which discusses the perils of Autocorrect in Excel spreadsheets for gene research. Apparently, just opening an excel file can activate the autocorrect \"feature\", which will dutifully go through all of the cells and change perfectly good gene names, like MARCH1 to a date. The issue was so bad that they had to rename the gene name in order to avoid this problem.</p>"},{"location":"matlabBasics/MatlabIntro/#user-guide-conventions","title":"User Guide Conventions","text":"<p>As we move forward, we will assume that you are already familiar with the MATLAB Desktop, especially the Command Window (and command line), the Workspace, and the Current folder.

First you needed to decide beforehand how many rows and tiles you want. Then, instead of simply calling <code>subplot</code>, you need to explicitly set the position the axes each time you would like to add a new axis to the figure, using the following syntax:</p> SUBPLOT set-up<pre><code>subplot(ROWS,COLUMNS,INDEX) \n</code></pre> <p>\u2026where <code>ROWS</code> equals the number of rows of axes that you want to add to the figure, <code>COLUMNS</code> equals the number of columns that you want to add, and <code>INDEX</code> indicates the location of the axis (in a ROW major order). Unlike the flow layout that you can use with <code>nexttile</code>, subplot requires everything to be predetermined and organized before you start plotting.</p> <p>For example, to create a 2X2 matrix of axes in a figure, you would run the following commands:</p> Example: 2X2 Tiled Axes using SUBPLOT<pre><code>fh = figure\nsph(1) = subplot (2,2,1) % Top Left Corner\ntitle ('Position One')\nsph(2) = subplot (2,2,2) % Top Right Corner\ntitle ('Position Two')\nsph(3) = subplot (2,2,3) % Bottom Left Corner\ntitle('Position Three')\nsph(4) = subplot (2,2,4) % Bottom Right Corner\ntitle('Position Four')\n</code></pre> <p>\u2026Notice that the first two inputs into each call to <code>subplot</code> are exactly the same: 2,2. These inputs indicate that there are should be 2 rows and 2 columns. The third input is the only input that changes, and it increases from 1 to 4. Also notice that the indexing here is ROW-MAJOR, for some reason, instead of COLUMN-MAJOR as is found in all other MATLAB indexing. This means that consecutive axes are beside each other across the rows first, then down across the columns. </p> <p>After you run the above code, you should see the following:</p> <p></p> <p>Again, the axes are empty because we didn't add any data.  Similar to the <code>nexttile</code> function, we add the plotting functions after we call <code>subplot</code>.</p> <p>Tiled Layout Take-Away</p> <p>There are two functions you can used to tile your axes: <code>nexttile</code> and <code>subplot</code>. The syntax for <code>nexttile</code> is easier and, in combination with <code>tiledlayout</code>, more powerful. For example, you can more easily control the spacing of the axes using <code>tiledlayout</code>. The function <code>subplot</code> is the older function. As such, it is more compatible with more functions. But, it is not as powerful as <code>nexttile</code> and doesn't have modern features like the flow layout or compact spacing.</p> <p>So, the main takeaway here is that you should use <code>nexttile</code> unless you are getting weird results.

Then move each Name-Email pair to a separate row. And then, have the First and Last Names and the emails in separate columns. Something more like this:</p> First Last email Professor Patella professor.patella@university.edu Sydney Synapse sydney.synapse@university.edu \u22ee <p>You could do this manually, by copying and pasting each bit one at a time, which would take quite a bit of time. OR, you could use MATLAB's handy String array functions.</p> <p>First, we separate all of the Name-Email pairs into separate lines.</p> Separate Name-Email pairs<pre><code>S_rows = split(orig_string, '; ') % split at semi-colon-space\n</code></pre> <p>\u2026Notice that the function split allows you to indicate what delimiter you want to use for the split. Here we indicate the semi-colon and a space as the delimiter. This means that the function will look for a semi-colon followed by a space and split up the string there. If there is a semi-colon, without a space, it won't split at that position.</p> split result<pre><code>S_rows = \n\n    10\u00d71 string array\n\n    \"Patella, Professor &lt;professor.patella@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Synapse, Sydney &lt;sydney.synapse@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Humerus, Harry &lt;harry.humerus@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Quadratus, Quentin &lt;quentin.quadratus@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Ligament, Linus &lt;linus.ligament@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Cortex, Chancellor &lt;chancellor.cortex@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Lymph, Lyndsay &lt;lyndsay.lymph@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Dendrite, Doctor &lt;doctor.dendrite@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Sarcomere, Sarah &lt;sarah.sarcomere@university.edu&gt;\"\n    \"Endothelium, Emmett &lt;emmett.endothelium@university.edu&gt;\"\n</code></pre> <p>\u2026And it works.

To make things a little more exciting, MATLAB uses multiple, different indexing systems. Here, we describe two of these indexing systems: standard or linear indexing.</p> <p></p> <p>On the left is the linear indexing system, which uses COLUMN MAJOR indexing. In column-major order, each element is numbered down each column first, before moving to the next column. So, to refer to the element in row 2, column 2, you simply use the index number 5. On the right is the standard indexing system, which has the following syntax: (row, column). In this scheme, the left number indicates the row and the right number indicates the column. To refer to the element in row 2, column 2, you would use the following syntax: (2,2). These two indexing schemes can be used interchangeably in MATLAB.</p> <p>The MATLAB syntax for indexing looks like this</p> <pre><code>variable_name(row,col) % standard indexing\nvariable_name(index) % linear indexing\n</code></pre> <p>This syntax returns the data contained in the elements of the array. You can think of this a little like the array of mailboxes you can find at your local post office. Each mailbox has a number on it, and the numbers are typically arrayed in some sort of sequential order. Opening one mailbox to access the contents is equivalent to indexing an element in this example.</p>"},{"location":"matlabBasics/Variables/#what-is-a-data-type","title":"What is a Data Type?","text":"<p>As discussed on the Data Overview page, we will primarily be storing three basic data types: Numbers, letters, and booleans. Also as previously discussed, computers are kind of dumb. And, to store these basic data types, you have to explicitly tell the software, \"Hey, I need to store a number (or a character or a logical).\" The way that we tell the software that we want to store one of these data types is through syntax. See the Array Assignment page for more details on the basic syntax we will use to indicate data type.</p> <p>To store these different data types, you need specialized variables. This specialization is known as a <code>class</code>. Each class has rules on what it can be used to store. For example, there is a class that can only store numbers, another that can only store characters and another that can only store booleans. These basic classes are labeled as:</p> <ul> <li>numeric</li> <li>character</li> <li>logical</li> </ul> <p>There are more classes (technically, there are 17 different classes), but we are going to start with these basic classes.</p> <p>A data type simply indicates what kind of data that variable can store, like Numbers, Characters, or True or Falses? In MATLAB, just to be tricky, a data type is also known as a Data Class.</p> <p>These classes have reserved names, as shown in this diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>In this course, we will learn about the following MATLAB classes:</p> Class Name Intended Use numeric numbers char characters string strings (eg words) cell complex content struct hierarchal data logical boolean (true / false) data table Complex Spreadsheet type data <p>To make things even worse, the numeric class actually comprises several subclasses with cryptic names like double or uint16. These numeric subclasses are used to store different kinds of numbers, like Whole Numbers (integers) vs Numbers With Decimal Points (Floating-Point Numbers).</p> <p>Here are some words you probably don't understand yet:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Floating-Point Number Classes: single, double (the default numeric class)</p> </li> <li> <p>Integer Classes:  int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64</p> </li> </ul> <p>Don't worry, we'll get to what this all means in later modules, but basically, a variable's numeric class affects the minimum and maximum numbers that can be stored in that variable.

Basically, you are adding or subtracting rows, columns, or slices. Subtracting rows and columns means that you are downsampling, which should ultimately create a smaller volume, which in turns saves memory (and hopefully avoids crashing Slicer). Ultimately, you want the total volume loaded into Slicer to take only 1/10 the amount of RAM that is available on your system. For 3D processing, you rarely benefit from having high in-plane resolution if distance between planes is large. For example, a volume of <code>2500 x 2500 x 500</code> (with spacing of <code>0.1x0.1x0.5</code>) will give you approximately same quality 3D reconstructions as a volume of <code>500 x 500 x 500</code> (with spacing of <code>0.5x0.5x0.5</code>).

The term 3D rendering refers to the computer graphics process of converting 3D models into 2D images for display on a screen. This process considers the positioning of the objects in a 3D scene and creates a 2D image based on this perspective. Any change in the view\u2014such as rotating the scene\u2014generates a new render that reflects this new perspective, as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>In 3D graphics, a viewing frustrum is the computed view from a virtual camera, represented as a truncated pyramid lying on its side. Notice the smaller end of the pyramid is closest to the camera, while the larger end is farther away, representing foreshortening. Everything between the near and far clip planes is the viewing area, and will be rendered. Here, the \"near clip plane\" represents what is rendered in the 3D Scene. Moving the camera changes the position of the viewing frustrum and renders a different image. For example, if you rotate the camera to the right, the red cylinder would appear in front of the yellow sphere.</p> <p>There are two main types of rendering that we deal with in this course: Volume and Surface Rendering.</p>"},{"location":"volumeProcessing/#volume-rendering","title":"Volume Rendering","text":"<p>With Volume Rendering, you visualize 3D structures by adjusting the transparency of voxels in a 3D volume. Often in this type of rendering, outer edge and background voxels are made completely transparent to allow viewing inside the volume.

These opacity values are set using a lookup table called an alphamap, which maps intensity values to opacity levels.</p> <p>In this way, volume rendering can be used as a quick and easy way to explore the internal structures of a volume.

Basically, you are adding or subtracting rows, columns, or slices. Subtracting rows and columns means that you are downsampling, which should ultimately create a smaller volume, which in turns saves memory (and hopefully avoids crashing Slicer). Ultimately, you want the total volume loaded into Slicer to take only 1/10 the amount of RAM that is available on your system. For 3D processing, you rarely benefit from having high in-plane resolution if distance between planes is large. For example, a volume of <code>2500 x 2500 x 500</code> (with spacing of <code>0.1x0.1x0.5</code>) will give you approximately same quality 3D reconstructions as a volume of <code>500 x 500 x 500</code> (with spacing of <code>0.5x0.5x0.5</code>). This means we rarely want to upsample and instead should use a larger Spacing scale setting to downsample the volume (even larger than shown here).

For these renders, we first convert the masks into label maps where each individual bubble has its own numeric label. In the label map before the watershed transform, there are 62 individual bubbles, including several fused bubbles. Fused bubbles here have the same color (see arrow and asterisk). In the label map after the transform, there are 71 bubbles and only one fused bubble remaining. Here the arrow points to an increased number of colors which indicates an increased number of separated bubbles. Whereas, the asterisk indicates a fused bubble which has the same color throughout. Note, this is the same fused bubble from the \"Before\" render, but its color has changed because its numeric label, which changed because there are an increase in the number unfused bubbles, shifting the labeling scheme for each bubble in the new label map.</p> Code to create the above Watershed Comparison Plot <p>To verify we separated touching bubbles using the watershed transform, we  transform the masks to label maps, where each bubble in the has a unique numeric label. In this label map, bubbles adjacent to each other tend to have adjacent numeric labels. Using <code>volshow</code>, we render the masks with the ColorMap set to <code>colorcube</code> \u2014 a randomized color map that assigns a different color to adjacent lookup values. This allows us to color nearby bubbles separate colors.</p> Visualize Watershed result<pre><code>% Create Label Maps\n[maskL, countMask] = bwlabeln(Mask); % create label map from mask\n[waterL, countWater] = bwlabeln(waterMask); % create label map from watershed mask\n\n% figure with grid layout\nfig = uifigure(Name=\"Watershed Transformation\",WindowStyle=\"normal\"); % create figure to hold viewers\ng = uigridlayout(fig,[1 2],Padding=[0 0 0 0]); % like tiledlayout, but for uifigures. 1x2 tiles\n\n% render the before transform volume\nhvr1 = viewer3d(parent=g, ... % add to first grid\n    BackgroundColor=\"white\", ... % white background\n    BackgroundGradient=\"off\", ... % no gradient\n    CameraZoom=1, ...\n    Title=sprintf(\"Before transform - %d\",countMask)); % set background color to white and turn off gradient\nvolshow(maskL, ... % volume before transform\n    Parent=hvr1, ... % display in first viewer3D\n    Colormap=colorcube, ... % random colors\n    RenderingStyle=\"CinematicRendering\")\n\n% render the after transform volume\nhvr2 = viewer3d(parent=g, ... % add to second grid\n    BackgroundColor=\"white\", ... % white background\n    BackgroundGradient=\"off\", ... % no gradient\n    CameraZoom=1, ...\n    Title=sprintf(\"After transform - %d\",countWater)); \nvolshow(waterL, ... % volume after transform\n    Parent=hvr2, ... % display in second viewer3D\n    Colormap=colorcube, ... % random colors\n    RenderingStyle=\"CinematicRendering\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"volumeProcessing/volumeSegmentation/#region-properties","title":"Region Properties","text":"<p>Finally, we can calculate the properties of the segmented bubbles using the function <code>regionprops3</code></p> Calculate properties<pre><code>rp = regionprops3(waterMask)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>rp =\n\n  71\u00d73 table\n\n    Volume             Centroid                                BoundingBox                    \n    ______    __________________________    __________________________________________________\n\n    14002     82.997    234.98    16.988     68.5    220.5      2.5       29       29       29\n    14008        195       134    19.997    180.5    119.5      5.5       29       29       29\n    13684     114.04    170.69    21.995     99.5    156.5      7.5       29       29       29\n\n      :                   :                                         :                         \n\n    14002     185.01    117.01       721    170.5    102.5    706.5       29       29       29\n    14015     151.01    95.005       727    136.5     80.5    712.5       29       29       29\n    13987     227.99    49.003       733    213.5     34.5    718.5       29       29       29\n</code></pre> <p><code>rp</code> has 71 rows: one row for each bubble.</p> Histogram<pre><code>histogram(rp.Volume,20)\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Histogram of bubble volumes</p> <p>A histogram of the bubble volumes easily identifies the fused bubble, which has a volume nearly twice the average bubble volume.</p> <p>We can exclude this volume from further analysis using a simple logical operation:</p> Exclude Fused Bubble<pre><code>la = rp.Volume &lt; 1.6e4; %  only volumes below cut-off\nfigure;\nhistogram(rp.Volume(la))\nxlabel(\"Volume (vox^3)\")\nset(gca,\"FontSize\",18)\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Histogram of only non-fused bubble volumes</p>"},{"location":"volumeProcessing/volumeSegmentation/#label-maps","title":"Label Maps","text":"<p>Often when segmenting, it is convenient to create label maps, instead of binary arrays.
